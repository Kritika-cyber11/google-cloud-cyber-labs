Hands-on Google Cloud cybersecurity labs demonstrating IAM, VPC security, and encryption
# Google Cloud Cybersecurity Labs Portfolio

Completed a comprehensive, hands-on series of Google Cloud labs focused on foundational cybersecurity concepts and cloud security best practices. Over the course of multiple guided projects, I:

## Google Cloud Cybersecurity Labs

### Recover VMs with Google Backup and DR Service
Configured Google Backup and DR to restore virtual machines after simulated data loss, demonstrating disaster-recovery planning. 

### Respond and Recover from a Data Breach
Investigated a simulated breach, contained the incident, and applied response steps to restore normal operations.

### Identify Vulnerabilities and Remediation Techniques
Scanned cloud resources for security weaknesses and implemented recommended fixes to reduce attack surface.

### Analyze Audit Logs Using BigQuery
Queried and visualized Cloud Audit Logs in BigQuery to detect suspicious activity and validate compliance.

### Explore False Positives Through Incident Detection
Reviewed security alerts to distinguish true threats from false positives, improving incident-response accuracy.

### Determine the Difference Between Normal Activity and an Incident
Analyzed system behaviors and traffic patterns to separate routine operations from potential security incidents.

### Change Firewall Rules Using Terraform and Cloud Shell
Used Terraform scripts and Cloud Shell to modify and automate firewall configurations for consistent network security.

### Create Symmetric and Asymmetric Keys
Generated and managed encryption keys with Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) to secure data at rest and in transit.

### Access a Firewall and Create a Rule
Manually configured Google Cloud firewall rules to restrict inbound and outbound traffic based on least-privilege principles.

### Create a Role in Google Cloud IAM
Built custom IAM roles to enforce granular access control and applied the principle of least privilege.

### Use Reports to Remediate Findings
Reviewed Security Command Center reports and applied remediations to close high-risk vulnerabilities.

### Create a VPC Using Cloud Shell
Provisioned a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with subnets and routing via Cloud Shell, enabling secure network segmentation.

**Skills Demonstrated:** Google Cloud security architecture, IAM policy design, network segmentation, encryption and key management, log analysis, incident detection and response, Linux system hardening, gcloud CLI.

**Outcome:** Gained practical experience securing cloud environments end-to-endâ€”covering identity, network, data, and workload protection.
**Portfolio description**: ## Google Cloud Cybersecurity Labs Portfolio
Completed a hands-on series of Google Cloud security labs covering identity, network, and data protection. Projects included creating custom IAM roles, building and securing VPC networks, changing firewall rules with Terraform, analyzing audit logs in BigQuery, detecting and investigating incidents, remediating vulnerabilities, encrypting data with symmetric and asymmetric keys, and recovering virtual machines with Backup and DR. These labs demonstrate practical skills in cloud access control, incident response, data encryption, and disaster recovery.
